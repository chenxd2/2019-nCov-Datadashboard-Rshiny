# 2019-nCov-Datadashboard-Rshiny
This project aims to display the spread of infectious disease (2019-nCoV - the novel coronavirus disease initially discovered in Chinese city of Wuhan) through time and space. The interactive graphics have the capability to recognize and track the changes in the complex system, therefore help to visualize and hypothesize important factors that may explain the spread pattern.
